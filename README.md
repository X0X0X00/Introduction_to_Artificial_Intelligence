# CSC 242 Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence
This course is designed to develop your understanding of the fundamental concepts in data mining and how they can be used to answer questions about real-world problems. These methods, and the underlying models, can be used to learn from existing data to make predictions about new data. The course will help you understand the mindset of creating a data project pipeline by covering topics on model development, causal inference, and traditional data mining. The class will both emphasize individual work and also team work by helping students solidify their knowledge through a final project.
